# Analysis: Why Two WR Edges in a 4-Node Cycle Are Impossible Under Snapshot Isolation

## Problem Statement

We want to understand why a 4-node cycle with two WR (Write-Read) edges is impossible under snapshot isolation, specifically the sequence: **RW → WW → WR → WR**.

## Background: Dependency Edge Types

In snapshot isolation, dependency edges represent causal relationships between transactions:

- **RW (Read-Write)**: Ti reads a value, Tj writes to the same key → Ti must start before Tj commits
- **WR (Write-Read)**: Ti writes a value, Tj reads that value → Ti must commit before Tj starts  
- **WW (Write-Write)**: Ti and Tj both write to the same key → conflict, one must abort

## Visual Representation

### Possible 4-Node Cycle (from your image)
```
      t3 ——WW——→ t1
      ↑           ↓
     WR          WW
      ↑           ↓
      t0 ←—RW—— t2
```
**Edge sequence**: RW → WR → WW → WW ✅ **POSSIBLE**

### Impossible 4-Node Cycle (what we're analyzing)
```
      t3 ——WR——→ t0
      ↑           ↓
     WR          RW
      ↑           ↓
      t2 ←—WW—— t1
```
**Edge sequence**: RW → WW → WR → WR ❌ **IMPOSSIBLE**

## Temporal Constraint Analysis

Let's analyze the timing constraints for the impossible cycle:

### Given edges:
- **t0 → t1**: RW (t0 reads, t1 writes)
- **t1 → t2**: WW (t1 and t2 have conflicting writes)
- **t2 → t3**: WR (t2 writes, t3 reads)
- **t3 → t0**: WR (t3 writes, t0 reads)

### Temporal constraints:

1. **t0 → t1 (RW)**: t0 must start before t1 commits
   - `start(t0) < commit(t1)`

2. **t1 → t2 (WW)**: Write-write conflict, one must abort
   - Either t1 aborts or t2 aborts (cannot both commit)

3. **t2 → t3 (WR)**: t2 must commit before t3 starts
   - `commit(t2) < start(t3)`

4. **t3 → t0 (WR)**: t3 must commit before t0 starts
   - `commit(t3) < start(t0)`

## The Contradiction

From constraints 3 and 4, we get:
- `commit(t2) < start(t3)` (from t2 → t3)
- `commit(t3) < start(t0)` (from t3 → t0)

This gives us: `commit(t2) < start(t3) < commit(t3) < start(t0)`

From constraint 1: `start(t0) < commit(t1)`

Combining: `commit(t2) < start(t3) < commit(t3) < start(t0) < commit(t1)`

But from constraint 2 (WW conflict), either:
- **Case A**: t1 commits and t2 aborts → t2 never commits, violating constraint 3
- **Case B**: t2 commits and t1 aborts → t1 never commits, violating constraint 1

## Key Insight: The Two-WR Problem

The fundamental issue is that **two WR edges in a cycle create a temporal ordering that conflicts with snapshot isolation's consistency guarantees**.

### Why WR edges are problematic:
1. **WR edges enforce strict temporal ordering**: Writer must commit before reader starts
2. **Two WR edges create a chain**: t2 commits → t3 starts → t3 commits → t0 starts
3. **This chain conflicts with other dependencies** in the cycle

### Contrast with the working case (RW → WR → WW → WW):
- Only **one WR edge** creates a single temporal constraint
- The other edges (RW, WW, WW) have more flexible timing requirements
- No contradiction arises in the temporal ordering

## Detailed Analysis of All Two-WR Patterns

Let's analyze each possible 4-node cycle with two WR edges to understand why they're all impossible.

### Pattern 1: RW → WW → WR → WR
```
      t3 ——WR——→ t0
      ↑           ↓
     WR          RW
      ↑           ↓
      t2 ←—WW—— t1
```

**Temporal constraints:**
- t0 → t1 (RW): `start(t0) < commit(t1)`
- t1 → t2 (WW): Either t1 or t2 aborts
- t2 → t3 (WR): `commit(t2) < start(t3)`
- t3 → t0 (WR): `commit(t3) < start(t0)`

**Contradiction:**
- From WR edges: `commit(t2) < start(t3) < commit(t3) < start(t0)`
- From RW edge: `start(t0) < commit(t1)`
- Combined: `commit(t2) < ... < start(t0) < commit(t1)`
- But WW means either t1 or t2 aborts - if t2 commits, t1 aborts (violating RW); if t1 commits, t2 aborts (violating first WR)

### Pattern 2: RW → WR → WW → WR
```
      t3 ——WR——→ t0
      ↑           ↓
     WW          RW
      ↑           ↓
      t2 ←—WR—— t1
```

**Temporal constraints:**
- t0 → t1 (RW): `start(t0) < commit(t1)`
- t1 → t2 (WR): `commit(t1) < start(t2)`
- t2 → t3 (WW): Either t2 or t3 aborts
- t3 → t0 (WR): `commit(t3) < start(t0)`

**Contradiction:**
- From t3 → t0: `commit(t3) < start(t0)`
- From t0 → t1: `start(t0) < commit(t1)`
- From t1 → t2: `commit(t1) < start(t2)`
- Combined: `commit(t3) < start(t0) < commit(t1) < start(t2)`
- But t2 and t3 have WW conflict - one must abort
- If t3 commits (needed for last WR), then t2 aborts, but we need t2 to participate in the WW edge

### Pattern 3: WW → WR → RW → WR
```
      t3 ——WR——→ t0
      ↑           ↓
     RW          WW
      ↑           ↓
      t2 ←—WR—— t1
```

**Temporal constraints:**
- t0 → t1 (WW): Either t0 or t1 aborts
- t1 → t2 (WR): `commit(t1) < start(t2)`
- t2 → t3 (RW): `start(t2) < commit(t3)`
- t3 → t0 (WR): `commit(t3) < start(t0)`

**Contradiction:**
- From WR edges: `commit(t1) < start(t2)` and `commit(t3) < start(t0)`
- From RW edge: `start(t2) < commit(t3)`
- Combined: `commit(t1) < start(t2) < commit(t3) < start(t0)`
- But t0 and t1 have WW conflict - if t1 commits (needed for first WR), then t0 aborts
- This violates the last WR edge which requires t0 to exist as a reader

### Pattern 4: WR → WW → WR → RW
```
      t3 ——RW——→ t0
      ↑           ↓
     WR          WR
      ↑           ↓
      t2 ←—WW—— t1
```

**Temporal constraints:**
- t0 → t1 (WR): `commit(t0) < start(t1)`
- t1 → t2 (WW): Either t1 or t2 aborts
- t2 → t3 (WR): `commit(t2) < start(t3)`
- t3 → t0 (RW): `start(t3) < commit(t0)`

**Contradiction:**
- From t0 → t1: `commit(t0) < start(t1)`
- From t2 → t3: `commit(t2) < start(t3)`
- From t3 → t0: `start(t3) < commit(t0)`
- Combined: `commit(t2) < start(t3) < commit(t0) < start(t1)`
- But t1 and t2 have WW conflict
- If t2 commits (needed for second WR), then t1 aborts, but we need t1 to exist for the WW edge
- If t1 commits, then t2 aborts, violating the second WR

### Pattern 5: WR → RW → WR → WW
```
      t3 ——WW——→ t0
      ↑           ↓
     WR          WR
      ↑           ↓
      t2 ←—RW—— t1
```

**Temporal constraints:**
- t0 → t1 (WR): `commit(t0) < start(t1)`
- t1 → t2 (RW): `start(t1) < commit(t2)`
- t2 → t3 (WR): `commit(t2) < start(t3)`
- t3 → t0 (WW): Either t3 or t0 aborts

**Contradiction:**
- From WR edges: `commit(t0) < start(t1)` and `commit(t2) < start(t3)`
- From RW edge: `start(t1) < commit(t2)`
- Combined: `commit(t0) < start(t1) < commit(t2) < start(t3)`
- For the WW edge, both t3 and t0 must be concurrent (overlapping execution)
- But we already have `commit(t0) < ... < start(t3)`, meaning t0 completes before t3 starts
- This violates the requirement for WW conflicts (concurrent execution)

### Pattern 6: WR → WR → Adjacent Edges
```
      t3 ————————→ t0
      ↑           ↓
     WR          WR
      ↑           ↓
      t2 ←——————— t1
```

**For adjacent WR edges (WR → WR → X → Y):**
- t0 → t1 (WR): `commit(t0) < start(t1)`
- t1 → t2 (WR): `commit(t1) < start(t2)`
- This creates: `commit(t0) < start(t1) < commit(t1) < start(t2)`

**The problem:** This creates a long temporal chain that makes it impossible for t2 to have any causal relationship back to t0 or t3 to complete the cycle. Any edge from t2 or t3 back to t0 would require time travel!

## Key Insight: Why Two WR Edges Break Cycles

The fundamental issue with two WR edges in a 4-node cycle is:

1. **WR edges create strict temporal ordering**: Each WR edge adds a "commit before start" constraint
2. **Two WR edges create temporal gaps**: These gaps make it impossible to "close" the cycle
3. **Other edge types can't bridge these gaps**:
   - RW requires overlap (start before commit)
   - WW requires concurrent execution
   - Neither can connect transactions separated by WR chains

This is why your TLA+ model found no instances after 500 million states - the pattern violates the fundamental temporal logic of snapshot isolation.

## Conclusion

The impossibility of two WR edges in a 4-node cycle under snapshot isolation stems from:

1. **Temporal ordering constraints**: WR edges require strict commit-before-start ordering
2. **Conflict resolution**: WW edges require one transaction to abort
3. **Cycle contradiction**: The combination creates unsatisfiable temporal constraints

This explains why the TLA+ model checker found no valid executions after exploring 500 million states - the pattern is fundamentally impossible under snapshot isolation's consistency model.

## Verification

The TLA+ specification `GNonadjacent4NodeCycle` correctly identifies this impossibility by:
- Exploring all possible transaction interleavings
- Checking for cycles with non-adjacent WR edges
- Finding no valid executions that satisfy snapshot isolation constraints

This mathematical proof-by-exhaustion confirms our theoretical analysis.
